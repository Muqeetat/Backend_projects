Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.

Please select the difficulty level:
1. Easy (10 chances)
2. Medium (5 chances)
3. Hard (3 chances)

Enter difficulty level (1 for Easy, 2 for Medium, 3 for Hard): 2

Great! You have selected the Medium level.
Let's start the game!

Attempt 1 of 5
Enter your guess (1-100): 50
Too low! Try again.

Attempt 2 of 5
Enter your guess (1-100): 75
Too high! Try again.

Attempt 3 of 5
Enter your guess (1-100): 60
Congratulations! You guessed the correct number 60 in 3 attempts.
