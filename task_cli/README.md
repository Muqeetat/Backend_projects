Hereâ€™s a summary of the commands you can use:

## Data Storage

- Tasks are stored in a JSON file (`tasks.json`). Each task is represented as a dictionary with the following fields:
  - `index`: The index of the task in the list.
  - `description`: The task's description.
  - `status`: The task's current status (e.g., "todo", "in-progress", "done").
  - `createdAt`: The timestamp when the task was created.
  - `updatedAt`: The timestamp when the task was last updated.

### Example `tasks.json`:
```json
[
  {
    "index": 0,
    "description": "Buy groceries",
    "status": "todo",
    "createdAt": "2025-01-12 12:00:00",
    "updatedAt": "2025-01-12 12:00:00"
  },
  {
    "index": 1,
    "description": "Complete homework",
    "status": "in-progress",
    "createdAt": "2025-01-12 12:30:00",
    "updatedAt": "2025-01-12 12:30:00"
  }
]
